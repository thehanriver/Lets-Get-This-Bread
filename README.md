# Lets Get This Bread! Game in Java

## Description
This was for a class project in which we had to make an app. My group (4 people) and I made an app called Lets Get This Bread using Java and Android Studios.
It's our first attempt and has a lot of bugs so please be gentle.

## My contribution
I was mainly in charge of connecting the front end to back end like connecting the buttons to the right function and etc. I also did all the sounds. Other than that, since 
I had to wait for whoever was doing the other parts, I touched on all aspects of the app besides the artwork.

## Problems
There's really too many to count right now. The buttons doesn't align correclty. For older Android phones, the app doesn't seem to work.
I don't think we are going to fix it but hopefully we will.

We are currently sitting at about +2,000 downloads and I think people are starting to figure out that some of the 5 star
reviews were from our friends so we can win the extra credit.
